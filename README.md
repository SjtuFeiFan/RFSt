The mat files are the matrices data used for the testing problems in our paper. People could also create some data randomly in other mannners. \p
The files test_LEP.m, test_NEP.m and test_OPP.m are the function for solving linear eigenvalue problem, total energy minimization and orthogonal Procrustes problem, respectively.
The file test_shell.m includes the testing codes for test_LEP.m and test_NEP. People could run the code blocks and view the results directly.
The file test_shell_OPP. includes the testing codes for test_OPP.m. People could run the code blocks and view the results directly.
The file test_manopt includs the testing codes for all problems in our paper by the steepest descent method in MANOPT. People could run the code blocks and view the results directly. But it is worth noting you must own the MANOPT package and should modify some stopping criteriors in the original files.
